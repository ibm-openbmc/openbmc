Subject: [PATCH 05/15] pmbus: (core) Add a one-shot retry in pmbus_set_page()

From extensive testing and tracing it was discovered that the MAX31785
occasionally fails to switch pages despite ACK'ing the PAGE PMBus data
write. I suspect this behaviour had been seen on other devices as well,
as pmbus_set_page() already read-back the freshly set value and errored
out if it wasn't what we requested.

In the case of the MAX31785 it was shown that a one-shot retry was
enough to get the PAGE write to stick if the inital command failed. To
improve robustness, only error out if the one-shot retry also fails to
stick.
