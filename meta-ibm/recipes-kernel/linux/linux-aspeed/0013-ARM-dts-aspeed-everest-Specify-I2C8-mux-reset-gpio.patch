Subject: [PATCH 13/22] ARM: dts: aspeed: everest: Specify I2C8 mux reset gpio

The PCA9546 on some Everest systems requires resetting before
it will operate properly, so specify the pin on the BMC that will
reset the mux before probing.

The mux reset is only necessary for non-GA level Tola (Everest system)
cards, so it is held in GHE instead of upstreaming.
